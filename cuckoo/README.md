This repository is a fork of the original CuckooDroid from idanr1986 (https://github.com/idanr1986/cuckoo-droid) but updated to fix a few bugs and allow dynamic analysis to work, as well as including the latest working version of Cuckoo Sandbox (1.2).


Documentation
=============
- CuckooDroid - http://cuckoo-droid.readthedocs.org/
- Cuckoo Sandbox - http://cuckoo.readthedocs.org/

You are advised to read the Cuckoo Sandbox documentation before using CuckooDroid!

Unfortunately, the CuckooDroid documentation is out of date, although it is still useful in getting to know the basics of the setup.
